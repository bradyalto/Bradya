# Hi I am Brady Altobello...

a senior **economics** major at Christopher Newport University. Growing up in Maryland is uncommon at CNU but someone that has really helped me become the person I am. Living right out of DC I have grown up loving DC sports. Going to the Washington Football Team, Georgetown basketball and Nationals games was always a fun thing to do growing up the youngest of 3 boys. It really jump started my love of sports. 

When my brothers were young they were introduced to lacrosse, and following in their footsteps I began playing at the age of **7**. After falling in love with the sport it dictated where I went, what I did and who I hung around with. It is also what drove me to come to CNU.

Last season we had our best season in program history making it to the final 4 of the NCAA tournament and this being my final season I plan to take us even further come spring. 

I was also driven to CNU through their great academic rigor. I am studying economics with a minor in Business administration. The analytical and theory pieces of the major have really pulled me in and made it something I _actually like_ learning about. 

This class is not one I would usually take, but I am excited to step out of my comfort zone, learn about the digital humanities and most importantly become a better writer. Writing has been a struggle of mine for as long as I can remember, and I have improved but knowing how important it is in the “real world” it's a skill I hope to improve upon. 

In the coming years I am very open minded. I could see myself moving into DC and working in finance or consulting. Both my parents grew up in the town where I live now and I have grown up close to most of my family, so living close to them would be ideal. But I also see some value in moving and learning a new city and getting some separation. I could see myself moving to a _smaller_ large city like Boston or Nashville.

Graduate school is also in the picture for me. With COVID-19 cutting out my sophomore lacrosse season, I have been given more eligibility to play. Lacrosse being such a big part of my life I am not sure I want to give it up, so it has opened the door to explore my options even more.  

This past summer my family was a little stir crazy from the COVID-19 lock down and was looking for a cool trip. One of the first Countries to open up to vaccinated Americans was Iceland so we took a 10-day trip, seeing the most beautiful waterfalls, lava fields and glaciers in the world. It was a great cap to a great summer with my family, and with everyone growing up I’m not sure how many more full family vacations we can have.
