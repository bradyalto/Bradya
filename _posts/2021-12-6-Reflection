Throughout this semester my definition hasn’t changed much, but my appreciation for the delivery method has grown a lot. Coming into the course I didn’t know anything about the digital humanities, but I really enjoyed learning about it. To me Digital humanities is the future of how content will be shared. An interactive digital way to send and receive information. Adds technology to the “old way” of sharing information. As more and more shifts online the field will grow exponentially. 

I thought all of the readings did a good job of teaching something. I enjoyed how all of them tried to do something different. Some helped to learn about DH, some just about the internet and some was designed to help improve writing skills. 

I thought the most interesting one was the second week of school where we read about different types of reading styles online

I had no idea but after reading this I now know that I use the spotted pastern, as seen above. It looks for a few words and looks heavily for the information they want to learn. In this example the right portion of the heat map shows where Mikhail Baryshnikov went to school. 

My favorite assignment was the thinglink map.

It was very nostalgic to create and think about but also fun and creative. In my 16 years of school, I have read papers and looked at projects to review. While they haven’t been digital humanities projects the idea of the review is something that I’ve been doing since elementary school, however the map we created was an entirely new experience. 
It allowed everyone to create their own map, with different experiences and different stories. Mine was a map of things that I consistently have done over the last four years. Going through other people's maps was super informative because it showed how people did different stories and even more interestingly how everyone uses and has different memories in different places. Although CNU is a smaller school everyone lives different lives.

I also enjoyed the about me blog. It was a relatively easy thing to write but allowed for students to learn GitHub which is very different than anything most people had used. The reviews were as expected. Not the best but not bad. As mentioned before, most people have done many reviews in their schooling, and they are a great way to help break down the techniques used. I thought it was smart to be given a list of projects for the first and then find our own for the second. 

In the course I think I have become a better writer. I am a firm believer in the fact that the only way to get better at something is to do it. In my personal life I play a lot of lacrosse, and the only way to improve is to work at your craft, and writing is the same way. I don’t ever do free writing exercises on my own time so if it wasn’t for school I wouldn’t write. The more you write the better writer you become. 

I also think the peer reviews helped me to understand the sentences that were not cohesive and needed work. It also helped me to proofread my work more because I didn’t want others seeing my work. The reading Shitty First Drafts helped me to be more confident in my drafts though. 

I think the course has also made me a better digital humanist. As previously mentioned, I didn't know what the field was coming into the semester. I not only learned about it but grew to appreciate the creativity needed to make a good project. I think the grant project helped my appreciation for the field. It was hard to think of an idea and then harder to focus the project enough to a specific field. 

I enjoyed the tweeting assignment because it was a new method of communication for me. I had a twitter before the course but didn’t tweet much. And similar to my thoughts about the Thinglink map, it was different then all of the assignments I’ve had in my other classes. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the class. I wasn’t sure what to expect but I had heard good things coming in. Learning about the digital humanities was great because I know to look for the elements when online or in museums. Also, with the field being relatively new I can see it grow and evolve as the years go by.
