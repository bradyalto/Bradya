**Summary:**

In response to the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed executive order 9066 which made much of the west coast a war zone which allowed Japanese Americans to be sent to relocation centers. This interactive map shows the different locations of the camps. As you click further into the locations, you see photos, journal pages and other firsthand accounts from the camps.

**Findings:**

Out of the Darkness does an excellent job of adding depth and history to the United States map. I really enjoyed how the map seemed to be in the background with the information and photos moving on and off the map. The variety of types of firsthand accounts is very impressive, although I was unable to view some of the links, the photos, journal entries and even children's cartoon strips really helped to put into perspective what it was like living within the camps. The project does a good job of getting you into the information, showing you the firsthand accounts and getting back to the map to see another location.

I had a good overall experience with the pictures of handwritten text but a few of them were a little too zoomed in causing me to feel like I missed a little information, although I was able to clearly see all the images. All the images fit where they are because all of the information is location based.

The images used are truly impressive. First off, the number of things saved is crazy as well as the variety. It was super cool to learn about the relationship between people as well as the organization of the people on the inside. The most interesting piece to me was the creation of baseball leagues within the camps, as well as schools for the kids to still learn. The Japanese people showed an incredible amount of resilience to make their lives as normal as possible considering they were ripped from their houses and forced to move.

The “learn more” section of the small box in the bottom left corner gives an in depth telling of the story. It is the only piece on Pearl Harbor and Japanese ancestry. It is also about the experience from the point of view of the Americans. This added more depth to the reason why as well as the propaganda during the war.

Overall, I think the project is awesome. It ties tech and history together allowing the observers to gain first person perspective to a blemish in our country's history. Its strengths out way its few flaws and the depth included due to its digital nature really enhance the user’s experience.

In the design tab you learn about the origin of the project. It was commissioned by Yale and designed by Matthew Carter. The style has been blended between the early twentieth century while also being modern enough to be read on the web. The software was written using a combination of HTML5 as well as CSS3, and was purpose built to be used on a 40-inch touchscreen using Firefox. Therefore, all of the back button and page refresh are built into the interface. The project has also been optimized for touchscreens, such as computers or mobile tablets but not for phones. It is also backwards compatible with tablets from six years ago due to the ability to shift screen resolution.
