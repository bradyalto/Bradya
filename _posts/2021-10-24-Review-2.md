### Summary
George R. R. Martin is a famous writer who is best known for his book series _A Song of Ice and Fire_. This story was then made into an even more popular HBO TV series called Game of Thrones. Atlas of Thrones is, as the name suggests, an interactive map allowing the viewer to see a map of the places their favorite characters traveled, battled and died in. In the top corner of the map is a legend allowing you to filter out the markings on the map. The purpose of this project is to help show the relative relation from one landmark to another. 


### Findings
Atlas of Thrones does a good job of putting the landmarks on “paper” and shows the relative distance between them. I really enjoyed the legend, which allowed you to filter the points of interest. Another key search feature was the search bar in the top left corner. When searching a place it would highlight the area as well as zoom in on the map. 

The map is very detailed naming hundreds of points of interest from not only the show but the book as well. While it is a strength, the viewers who only watched the show might be overwhelmed with many of the locations only talked about in the book series. A toggle filtering between show, book and both would be beneficial.

My one major flaw with the site is the lack of information given about the points of interest. When you click a point the only thing detail given is the name of the site. In order to improve on the effectiveness of the resource, one could add a pop up to give a photo, video or  information about who lives there, and why it was important to the plot of the story. 

Another minor flaw with the website was the lack of an about section. There is no information about who created the site, when it was created, or who funded the project. Although this doesn’t affect the effectiveness of the project, it is worth noting. 

The lack of “about” section also means there is no information given on what program was used to create the project.

A major positive of this project is the mobile web version on the site. On multiple mobile browsers the website worked smoothly. The legend was easily accessible and filtered the point of interest well. Moving the map was easier with the touch screen as well.

The city's portion of the key is very interesting. It creates a point for the many different cities in the land but doesn’t appear to do all of them. Already on the map are some black points of big cities and the tab doesn’t match completely with the black text. Winterfell for example, which is arguably the most important city in the whole series, is permanently on the map in black but never shows up as a clickable location. With the lack of further information given by the site this isn’t the end of the world because it is still visible on the map but strange that it is the only one left off.  

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. While there were some flaws and things that could have been added to further improve its effectiveness the site does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it very well. The whole experience is smooth, well organized and easier to understand for many people when first accessing the site.
